# What is AWS

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world's most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform, offering over 200 fully featured services from data centers globally.

## Overview

AWS provides on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to individuals, companies, and governments on a metered pay-as-you-go basis. It was launched in 2006 and has since become the leading cloud service provider.

## What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider like AWS.

### Key Characteristics

- **Measured Service**: Pay only for what you use

### Service Models

- **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**: Raw compute, storage, and networking
- **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**: Managed platform for application development
- **Software as a Service (SaaS)**: Complete software solutions
